# Response Style Guide

## Natural, Context-Aware Responses

### ✅ **Core Philosophy**
The AI adapts its response style based on the question type and complexity:
- **Simple questions** → Direct, concise answers
- **Complex topics** → Detailed explanations with optional structure
- **How-to questions** → Practical steps and procedures
- **Definitions** → Clear explanations with context
- **Comparisons** → Differences and similarities explained

### ✅ **Flexible Structure**
Responses include ONLY relevant sections (not all sections for every answer):

1. **Main Answer** (always present) - Natural, conversational response
2. **Key Points** (optional) - For complex topics needing summary
3. **Requirements** (optional) - When discussing rules and obligations
4. **Implementation Steps** (optional) - For how-to questions
5. **Important Considerations** (optional) - Warnings and edge cases
6. **Key Terms** (optional) - Definitions when needed
7. **References** (when available) - Page citations
8. **Related Questions** (optional) - Follow-up suggestions

### ✅ **Smart Keyword Bolding**
Auto-bolded terms include:
- **Core concepts**: Shariah, Fiqh, Fatwa, AAOIFI
- **Prohibitions**: Riba, Gharar, Maysir
- **Contracts**: Murabaha, Mudarabah, Musharakah, Ijarah
- **Instruments**: Sukuk, Wakalah, Qard, Salam
- **Governance**: Supervisory Board, Compliance

## Example Outputs

### Simple Question: "What is Murabaha?"
```markdown
**Murabaha** is a **Shariah-compliant** sales-based financing contract where a financial institution purchases an asset and sells it to a customer at a marked-up price, with the profit margin disclosed upfront. The payment can be deferred or made in installments. According to page 245, **Murabaha** must involve actual ownership and possession by the seller before resale, distinguishing it from **Riba** (interest-based lending).

**Key Terms**
**Murabaha**: Cost-plus-profit sale contract
**Riba**: Prohibited interest or usury in **Islamic finance**

### Complex Question: "How should institutions implement Shariah compliance monitoring?"
```markdown
**Shariah compliance** monitoring requires a multi-layered approach involving both ex-ante and ex-post oversight mechanisms. According to page 1262, **Islamic financial institutions** must establish formal procedures covering the entire product lifecycle from adoption to implementation.

The monitoring framework should integrate three key components: preventive controls through pre-approval by the **Shariah Board**, ongoing surveillance through periodic departmental reviews, and corrective mechanisms through regular **reporting** to the **Shariah Committee**.

### Implementation Steps
1. Establish a formal **Shariah** product approval process with documented workflows
2. Configure periodic monitoring visits to departments offering **Islamic** products
3. Set up **reporting** mechanisms to the **Shariah Committee** for oversight
4. Document all **contracts**, **pledges**, and promises for **enforceability** review
5. Train staff on **Shariah compliance** requirements and red flags

### Important Considerations
- Treating **pledges** as **enforceable contracts** without proper **Shariah** review
- Inadequate monitoring frequency leading to **compliance** gaps
- Lack of documentation for audit trails
