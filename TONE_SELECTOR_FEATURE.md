## Example Responses

### Question: "What is Murabaha?"

**Conversational:**
```
Hey! So Murabaha is basically a sales-based financing contract that's 
Shariah-compliant. Think of it like this: instead of the bank lending 
you money with interest (which is Riba and prohibited), the bank 
actually buys the item you need and then sells it to you at a markup...
```

**Concise:**
```
Murabaha: Cost-plus-profit sale contract.
- Bank purchases asset
- Sells to customer at marked-up price
- Profit disclosed upfront
- Payment deferred/installments (p. 245)
```

**Detailed:**
```
Murabaha represents one of the most widely utilized Shariah-compliant 
financing mechanisms in Islamic banking. At its core, Murabaha is a 
sales contract where the seller explicitly discloses the cost of the 
commodity and the profit margin to the buyer. According to page 245...

```

**Professional:**
```
Murabaha constitutes a sales-based financing structure wherein the 
financial institution procures an asset and subsequently transfers 
ownership to the client at a predetermined markup. The transaction must 
comply with the following requirements: [Page 245]
- Actual ownership and possession by the seller
- Explicit disclosure of cost and profit components
- Absence of Riba elements...
```

**Simple:**
```
Imagine you want to buy a car but don't have the money. In regular 
banks, they'd lend you money and charge interest. But in Islamic 
banking, they do something different called Murabaha:

1. The bank buys the car
2. The bank sells it to you for a bit more
3. You pay them back over time

The key difference? The bank actually owns the car first, and they tell 
you exactly how much extra they're charging. This way, it's a sale, not 
a loan with interest!
```
